# User story 3

## Standard scenario
The movement of turtles in general and in relation to the objective area has
already been tested in several other tests, such as user story 1, 5 and 6.
With user testing we did not receive complaints about turtle movement.

## Edge case
The movement of turtles with multiple players in the game has been 
extensively playtested by us and we are satisfied with the movement they
portray. The first round of user testing had about 17 participants, 
of which 12 percent found the game difficult to play, and 50 percent 
felt neutral.
The first to last round of user testing, after having made several
improvements, 78 percent of 9 users found the game easy to play, with the
rest feeling neutral.
