# User Story 13
### Standard Scenario

When starting on the project it was quite difficult to approach the IMOVE framework since the README included with the project does not give any technical details at all. It just explains in general how the framework works and which functionality resides in which folder.

Furthermore, the documentation within the code was often unclear, missing, incomplete or incorrect/outdated. Which only made the process of understanding the framework more difficult.

The studio was mainly interested in how the game could be integrated with the framework. Once the studio became more familiar with the framework's directory structure and the general architecture of IMOVE, the ExampleScene class was found. This was used as a basis for the integration.

After a lot of trial and error the studio figured out how to run the framework and how to integrate the game logic with it.

The configurable variables of IMOVE were not documented at all so tweaking this was mostly done by more trial and error or contacting the original developers of IMOVE.

The original report of the IMOVE project contained some more details on the framework but unfortunately not enough.

Eventually, the studio learned enough about the framework to be able to integrate the framework with the game under the IMOVE/.../GameIntegration folder.
After a lot of testing the studio was also able to get the tracking considerably more accurate with an additional buffer implementation as described in the final report.
