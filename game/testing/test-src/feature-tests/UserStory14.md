The studio had to deliver a draft version for the Product Planning
which was succesfully delivered before the deadline.  

The studio received a document with the initial feedback on the draft 
version in which a lot of problems were exposed that were not noticed before. 
Using this feedback, the studio improved their Product Planning and made sure 
all given feedback was properly processed in the paper.  

After the Product Planning was complete, the studio delivered this
final version of the Product Planning again before the deadline without
any problems. The grade that was received on this Product Planning was sufficient 
and well received.

This Product Planning was properly used during the development of the
product to assist the developers with for consult and as a guideline on
what had to be worked on next.
