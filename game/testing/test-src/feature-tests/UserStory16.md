## Userstory 16

The studio originally created this userstory to give more meaning to the project than just being a game.
Unfortunately there was not enough time for the studio to do something with this idea because of deadlines.
Other aspects of the game simply had higher priority to finish before the final delivery date.

However, as a proof of concept, a SHOW_SPONSOR variable was added which will cause a placeholder
charity organisation logo to be rendered on the end screen. The studio still believes that
this is a great platform to reach people for charity organisations and not only for turtles
since the game mechanics can also work with other themes.
