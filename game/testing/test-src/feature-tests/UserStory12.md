## Userstory 12

Before the group members started to write code, all developers watched C++ tutorials online.
After that, they were still not very experienced with programming in C++ and errors were still made.
But during the course of the project, the skills improved and they identified problems and tried to
prevent them in the future. The studio also added the tool CPPCheck, which warns developers about possible memory
leaks and other problems.

As a result, the studio has a product which works well, and so far has not seen any problems when it ran
for a longer time.

The studio has used the CLion code formatter to format the codebase.

Every studio member has a basic understanding of most concepts in C++ but the language is quite broad and complex 
so not all C++ concepts were thoroughly studied. However, with the base knowledge gained by this project
all studio members will be able to easily continue studying C++.
