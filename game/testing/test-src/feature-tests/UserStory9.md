## Userstory 9

Inside the README of the project files, there is a complete deployment guide. According to the user story,
the game software is already installed. After that, the only thing left to do to play the game with IMOVE
is to run the buildAndRunIMOVE.sh script, which is also documented in the deployment guide.

The userstory also stated that the game should be able to run all day. However running the game for a day
would require the studio to have access to the Aula IMOVE setup all day, which is not possible. But, the game has ran
for about 45 minutes without any problems or loss in performance. This is as close as the studio can get with
testing the endurance, at least until they can have the Aula setup for an entire day.
