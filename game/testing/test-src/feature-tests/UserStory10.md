### Standard Scenario

Unfortunately the studio was not able to test this because the Aula was not available for an entire day.

However, as described in UserStory9.md, the game did run for more then 45 minutes without the need of any supervision because the game loop continued to function and bugged players were removed automatically.

### Edge Case

The game can still be launched after a crash as described in UserStory7.md
