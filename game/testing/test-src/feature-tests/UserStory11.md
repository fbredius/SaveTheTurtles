# User story 11

## Standard scenario
The studio thought that a statement such as "the turtle's movement is lifelike and
realistic" was difficult to quantify and therefore also difficult to feature test.
This is why they based our justification of this user story completion on the
results of the user testing. Of about 38 users 19 users mentioned that
they liked the visuals of the game. Only 11 users remarked that they did not
like the visuals. Of the total amount of users, 29 agreed on the statement "I had
fun playing the game." We can therefore conclude that the average user liked
what the turtles looked like, how they moved and that they enjoyed themselves
while playing the game.

To help facilitate natural movement, the studio has implemented animations and
linear interpolation for the turtles to turn more smoothly. These features
have been unit tested where possible and play tested by the studio.
