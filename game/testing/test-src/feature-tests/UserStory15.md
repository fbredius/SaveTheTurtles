## Standard scenario
The studio has made a game design document to help them with the creation
of the game, this document contained all the features that were to be
implemented. This document has been handed in before the given deadline.

Creating such a document always helps one to understand every aspect
of the game better in the first place, but all members have frequently
consulted the document during the project. The Teaching assistants
had given feedback on the draft, but they expressed that they were
satisfied with the final version of the game design document.
